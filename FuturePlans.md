# Future plans

- Support old help CHM file format with defined conversion steps.
- Prepare description help ZIP file for the solution.
- Left panel with multi pages:
  - User notes list and links to headings inside documents
- Possibility to add custom user note to anchor (heading) + data management in separated ZIP
- Splash screen for helpfile
- In commit 1119768 there has been done try with scratch image, but failed so alpine was used. Retry it.
- Nice URLs (?id=5&d=...&p=... vs /hello.md/3)
- Event bus instead of interconnections
- RSS generator
- sitemap.xml
- Editor for creating help files
- Improve reading of markdowns - filter out YAML, TOML, JSON headings (currently not touching them) - getting information partially from them
- Converting TEX file from archive to md format (investigation if possible, base support only?)
- Improve WCAG and other standards
- United help system (grouping of single help files (united tree and dictionaries) - currently only links outside helpfile are allowed)
- Associated topics groups (something like links/keywords/topics, see also )
- Dead links checker
- Idea: Explore possibilities of creating fulltext search on the fly without CI pre-built fulltext index
- Discussion (e.g.: Disqus or other service) plugin
