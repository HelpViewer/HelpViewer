# Future plans

- Support old help CHM file format with defined conversion steps.
- Prepare description help ZIP file for the solution.
- Definition of keyword lists and mapping to topic files (md, htm)
- Left panel with multi pages:
  - Index (keywords), 
  - Search (fulltext search in ZIP file - investigation if possible), 
  - User notes list and links to headings inside documents
- Possibility to add custom user note to anchor (heading) + data management in separated ZIP
- Custom help file HTML layout support (appendable to body + refactor)
